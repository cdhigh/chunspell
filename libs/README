The compiled libraries for Microsoft Visual Studio are included, because they are very difficult to build automatically.

For other platforms besides windows, Hunspell is dynamically downloaded and built.

The hunspell license is included in HUNSPELL_LICENSE_LESSER for the two compiled binaries -- its compatible with this repositories license.



Steps to reproduce the msvc files:


Install Visual Studios 2019.

Run find_library.py to download windows usuable version of hunspell. This will
populate the 'external' directory.

With Visual Studio, open 'external\hunspell-1.7.0\msvc\Hunspell.sln'.
Allow visual studio to upgrade the solution if prompted.

Then right click on libhunspell from the solution explorer and choose 'properties'.
Change to Release Configuration
Under 'C/C++ -> All Options' make the following changes:
* Runtime Library -> DLL Multi-Threaded (/MD)

Then click on Configuration Manager in upper right corner.
Uncheck 'Build' checkboxes for 'hunspell' and 'testparser' (or delete those options)
Under 'libhunspell -> platform' select '<New>'
Change New platform dropdown select 'x64' and click 'Ok'

From top navigation bar, select Release and x64.
Then from the menu select 'Build -> Build Solution'.

Go to external\hunspell-1.7.0\msvc\x64\Release\' copy 'libhunspell.lib' to
'chunspell/libs/msvc/libhunspell-msvc14-x64.lib'.

Now for 32 bit build:

From top navigation bar, select Release and Win32. Make sure the configurations changes
are the same for the Win32 profile. Then from the menu select 'Build -> Build Solution'.

Go to external\hunspell-1.7.0\msvc\Release\libhunspell\' copy 'libhunspell.lib' to
'chunspell/libs/msvc/libhunspell-msvc14-x86.lib'.


You should now have 2 new files:
libhunspell-msvc14-x86.lib
libhunspell-msvc14-x64.lib
